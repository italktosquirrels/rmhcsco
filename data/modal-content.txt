Happy Wheels Cart Prototype


Paragraph
---------------


Welcome to the Happy Wheels Cart Prototype site!


The Senior Communications / Branding Manager at RMHCSCO and The Agency Team at Mohawk College presented 
us with the Happy Wheels Cart idea to build into an interactive experience for accepting smaller donations 
and building a sense of community while helping families in need. 

The Happy Wheels Cart provides things like snacks and hot drinks to families at the hospital. 
By incorporating the Happy Wheels Cart idea, we can accept these smaller donations to support 
the Cart and keep it stocked as it makes its way around the hospital.
